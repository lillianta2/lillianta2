## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student in their third year and studying :sparkles: Chemistry :sparkles: at McMaster University

My main interests in chemistry are organic and inorganic chemistry, specifically enjoy chemical syntheses :test_tube: 

Outside of chemistry, three things I enjoy in my free time are
- walks or bicycling
- board games
- watching movies/tv shows

I'm very new to the GitHub community, but happy to learn more about it :smile:
